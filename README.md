## Customization

### Adding New Products
1. Update the product options in the EJS templates (`stock.ejs`, `sales.ejs`)
2. Add new product options in the dashboard info section
3. No database changes required - products are stored as text

### Modifying Branch Names
1. Update branch names in `branch-selection.ejs`
2. Update branch references in other templates
3. Update the branch validation in server routes

### Changing Thermal Receipt Size
1. Modify the CSS `@page` size in the print styles
2. Adjust font sizes and spacing accordingly
3. Test with your specific thermal printer

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important for Production Use**:

1. **Password Security**: The current implementation uses plaintext passwords. For production:
   - Implement password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Add password complexity requirements
   - Enable password reset functionality

2. **Session Security**: 
   - Use secure session cookies in production
   - Implement session timeout
   - Use HTTPS in production

3. **Database Security**:
   - Move to a production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
   - Implement proper database user permissions
   - Add database connection encryption

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Add server-side input validation
   - Implement SQL injection protection
   - Add XSS protection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 already in use**:
   ```bash
   # Use a different port
   PORT=3001 npm start
   ```

2. **Database permission errors**:
   - Ensure write permissions in the application directory
   - Check if `shop.db` file is created successfully

3. **Print layout issues**:
   - Adjust CSS print styles in `style.css`
   - Test with different browsers
   - Check printer paper size settings

4. **Session issues**:
   - Clear browser cookies and try again
   - Restart the server application

## Support

For technical support or feature requests, please check the following:

1. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Review server logs for backend errors
4. Ensure the database file has proper permissions
